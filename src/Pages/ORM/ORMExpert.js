                            <p className='text-center'>A business needs to review its reputation as well as the brand value on a periodic basis so that it can work on improving them. At Orange Mantra, we initiate the ORM process by examining your brand reputation, its market positioning, and the competition you have. In the case of a reputation attack, we investigate untraceable threats and attackers for you. Our cyber investigative techniques include data cross-indexing and email tracing.</p>

                            <p className='text-center'>ORM is not just about being reactive and countering an attack on the business reputation. A sound strategy also includes a proactive approach that ensures that damage is not inflicted in the first place. As a part of our Online Reputation Management Services, we frame a fool-proof strategy that utilizes the existing online resources to enhance the visibility as well as the reputation of the brand.</p>
